The Master Class Introduction

General Information
This Master Class is organized in 3 different modules:

Document, Discover and Evolve the REST API (7 lessons)
Monitoring and Metrics for the API (5 lessons)
CI and CD Pipelines for the API (6 lessons)
Each Module is organized in several video Lessons - each containing lesson notes and resources. 
The Lessons are meant to be experienced as video lessons, and the notes should be used as a reference not as comprehensive documentation.


The Project Code And New Tech
The user management project has 6 sub-modules in the Starter Class (in the later classes, it's going to have 5-6):

common-client - holds common, generic infrastructure to build a client for the REST API
common-test - holds common testing infrastructure that it not domain specific
common - holds common, generic infrastructure (utilities, abstract classes, etc) that are not domain specific
um-client - holds the actual domain-specific client logic
um-ui - holds the simple front-end app (only exists in a few lessons)
um-webapp - holds the actual, domain specific REST API

Before we get started, let's have a quick look at the other technologies we're going to use in these final few modules (and haven't used in Modules 1-6).

The main one is JPA Metamodels - https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/5.0/topical/html/metamodelgen/MetamodelGenerator.html . These are, simply put - helper classes that we can use alongside our entities, with JPA Criteria, to write queries easier.

Live Workshop
API Discoverability and good use of Hypermedia are definitely the hallmarks of a mature, well designed API.

This module - Module 7 - goes over the basics and explores some very useful examples and scenarios where HATEOAS really helps out a client of the API.

But the Spring Hateoas and especially the Spring Data REST projects are really the way to go in the Spring ecosystem - so we definitely need to focus on implementing more advanced scenarios in the live workshop:

The Certification Class
If you need the Certificate of Completion for the course, definitely have a look at the new Certification Class. 
I introduced this class out of a number of conversations with students of the course, so I hope it's useful.

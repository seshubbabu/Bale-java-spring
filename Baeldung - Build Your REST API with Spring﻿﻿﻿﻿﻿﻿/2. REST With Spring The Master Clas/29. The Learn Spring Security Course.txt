The Learn Spring Security Course

The course you've just finished - REST With Spring - was all about building a REST API with Spring. And security was, of course, a major focus when building the API.

That might be enough, but if you want to dig a lot deeper into security and use Spring Security to its full potential, definitely have a look at the Learn Spring Security course.

And since you're already a student, email me for the custom coupon of the bulk package.


Cheers and keep in touch,

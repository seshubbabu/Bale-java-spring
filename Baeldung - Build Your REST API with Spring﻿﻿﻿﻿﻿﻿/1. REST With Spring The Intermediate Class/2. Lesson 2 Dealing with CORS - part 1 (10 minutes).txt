Learn about and understand the Same Origin Policy restriction of the browser, CORS and how to relax that restriction in Spring.

The Same Origin Policy
The Same Origin Policy is an important restriction implemented by all major browsers in order to not allow JS code from making requests against a different origin.

An Origin:

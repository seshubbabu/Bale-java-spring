1. Goals
Implement a fully working OAuth2 flow with Spring Security.


2. Lesson Notes
The Authorization Server
We're defining the Authorization Server configuration here, with the @EnableAuthorizationServer annotation and the standard configurer-adapter style of configuration. 
We're going to go with the Password Flow because the first usecase for OAuth is going to be the suite of live tests - which is a trusted type of client.

A quick note - the Authorization Server endpoint is itself secured via Basic Authentication with the client credentials - the client id and the secret.

The Tokens endpoint for a local deployment: http://localhost:8082/um-webapp/oauth/token

The Resource Server
The Resource Server is effectively the API - so, the config for it will be our main security configuration.

A quick side-note here is that this configuration is almost exactly the same with our previous config. The only few differences to get a full OAuth config are - we're no longer defining Basic Auth and we're using the @EnableResourceServer annotation and the corresponding configurer-adapter.
